# üåÄ Docker Multi-Network Container Communication Demo

This guide demonstrates creating multiple Docker networks, attaching containers, and testing network connectivity between them.

## üåê Network Topology Overview

    firstNetwork --> backend2;
    secondNetwork[secondNetwork] --> backend2;
    secondNetwork --> db;
```

üõ†Ô∏è Setup Commands

1. Create Docker Networks
 
```
docker network create firstNetwork
docker network create secondNetwork
```

---

2. Launch Containers

```
# Launch containers in firstNetwork
docker run -d --name=backend1 --network=firstNetwork nginx
docker run -d --name=backend2 --network=firstNetwork nginx

# Launch db container in secondNetwork
docker run -d --name=db --network=secondNetwork nginx

```

---

3. Connect backend2 to secondNetwork

```
docker network connect secondNetwork backend2
```

---

üîç Verification Steps

1. Inspect Container Networks

```
docker inspect backend1
docker inspect backend2
```

---

2. Test Connectivity
  ‚è∫ From backend1:

```
docker exec -it backend1 bash
apt update && apt install iputils-ping -y
ping backend2  # Should succeed (same network)
ping db        # Should fail (different networks)

```

![Ping Backend2](Image/db-backend2-ping.png)

---

From backend2:

```
docker exec -it backend2 bash
apt update && apt install iputils-ping -y
ping backend1  # Should succeed (same network)
ping db        # Should succeed (connected to both networks)

```
![Ping Backend 2](Image/Backend2.png)

---

From db:

```
docker exec -it db bash
apt update && apt install iputils-ping -y
ping backend2  # Should succeed
ping backend1  # Should fail

```
![Ping DB](Image/ping-db.png)

---

üìå Key Observations

1. Network Isolation:
  ‚è∫ backend1 can only communicate with backend2 (same network)

  ‚è∫ db can only communicate with backend2 (no direct route to backend1)

2.Multi-Homed Container:

  ‚è∫ backend2 can communicate with both networks as it's attached to both

3DNS Resolution:

  ‚è∫ Docker provides automatic DNS resolution for container names within the same network

---

üßπ Cleanup Commands

```
docker stop backend1 backend2 db
docker rm backend1 backend2 db
docker network rm firstNetwork secondNetwork
```
