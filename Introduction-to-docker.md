## 🔰 What is Docker?

Docker is an open-source platform that helps you package, deploy, and run applications inside lightweight virtual environments called "containers." It allows you to run your application and its dependencies together as a portable unit.

### 📦 What is a Docker Container?

A container is an isolated environment where an application runs with its own filesystem, network, libraries, and configurations, separated from other containers and the host system.

### 🚀 Why use Docker?

✅ Same code, same environment: solves the “It works on my machine” problem

✅ Lightweight and fast: much lighter and faster than virtual machines (VMs)

✅ Scalable: ideal for microservices and cloud applications

✅ Automation-friendly: easy to integrate into CI/CD pipelines

### 🔗 Core Components of Docker:

- **Docker Image** – a template containing executable code and files  
- **Docker Container** – a running copy of an image  
- **Dockerfile** – script to build images  
- **Docker Compose** – tool to manage multiple containers together  

### 🧠 How does Docker work?

Docker uses Linux kernel features like cgroups and namespaces to isolate applications. Unlike heavy virtualization in VMs, Docker containers share the host OS kernel but remain isolated at the process level.

### 🏗️ Where is Docker used?

✅ Software Development (creating local development environments)  
✅ Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)  
✅ Cloud Deployments (AWS, Azure, GCP)  
✅ Microservices Architectures  
✅ DevOps and Automation  

### 🆚 Docker vs Virtual Machine

| Feature          | Docker                 | Virtual Machine           |
|------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| Resource Usage   | Low (Lightweight)      | High (Heavyweight)       |
| Startup Time     | Seconds                | Minutes                  |
| Isolation       | Process-level isolation | Full OS isolation        |
| Performance     | High                   | Relatively slower        |

### 📈 Why is Docker popular?

- Open-source with strong community support  
- Easy to build and share images  
- Cloud-friendly and scalable  
- Provides security and isolation
